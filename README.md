## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Fonts from [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com)
- Visual Studio Code
- Chrome Developer Tools

### What I learned

    I was able to make use of media queries  for my responsive design without referring to any website or document and was also able to use svg as backgrounds. See the code snippet below:

```html
<header>
    <img src="./images/logo.svg" alt="Huddle Logo">
</header>
```
```css
header img
{
    width: 200px;
    padding: 20px;
}
```


### Continued development

    I am going to keep on taking on challenges that require responsive design so as to master media queries
